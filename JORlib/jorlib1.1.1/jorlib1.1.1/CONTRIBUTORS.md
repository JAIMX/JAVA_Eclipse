jORLib wouldn't be the library it is today without the source contributions and suggestions made by the authors:

- Joris Kinable (project founder & current administrator)
- David Hadka
- Frans Lelieveld

(if we have missed your name on this list, please email us to get it fixed).

Other people have also helped in different ways: reporting bugs,requesting features, commenting, and by merely asking very good questions.

Many thanks to all of you.
